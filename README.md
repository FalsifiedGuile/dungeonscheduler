# Dungeon Scheduler

This project was generated with [ngX-Rocket](https://github.com/ngx-rocket/generator-ngx-rocket/)
version 7.0.2

# Getting started

1. Go to project folder and install dependencies:
 ```sh
 npm install
 ```

2. Launch development server, and open `localhost:4200` in your browser:
 ```sh
 npm run dev
 ```
 
## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change
any of the source files.
You should not use `ng serve` directly, as it does not use the backend proxy configuration by default.
